# Withdrawal and Reservation System Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. **Withdrawal System Updates**

#### **OTP Verification for Withdrawals**
- **Before**: Single-step withdrawal with Google Authenticator only
- **After**: Two-step withdrawal process:
  1. **Step 1**: User requests withdrawal â†’ OTP sent to email
  2. **Step 2**: User confirms with OTP + Google Authenticator code

#### **New Withdrawal Flow**
```
1. POST /api/v1/withdraw/withdraw
   Body: { "amount": 100 }
   Response: "OTP sent to your email"

2. POST /api/v1/withdraw/withdraw/confirm
   Body: { "amount": 100, "googleAuthCode": "123456", "otp": "789012" }
   Response: "Withdrawal request submitted"
```

#### **No Fees on Rejection**
- **Before**: Fees were deducted even on withdrawal rejection
- **After**: No fees deducted on rejection - full amount refunded
- **Implementation**: Updated withdrawal rejection logic to refund full amount including fees

### 2. **Reservation System Updates**

#### **NFT-Based Reservations**
- **Before**: Reservations were automatically assigned based on user's reservation count
- **After**: Users can choose specific NFTs to reserve
- **New Flow**:
  1. Get available NFTs: `GET /api/v1/reservation/available`
  2. Reserve specific NFT: `POST /api/v1/reservation/reserve` with `{ "nftId": "..." }`

#### **NFT Availability Check**
- Added validation to prevent multiple users from reserving the same NFT on the same day
- Only shows NFTs that haven't been reserved today

### 3. **UK Timezone Implementation**

#### **System-Wide UK Timezone**
- **Before**: System used server's local timezone
- **After**: All time operations use UK timezone (GMT/BST)
- **Implementation**: Created `utils/timezone.js` with UK timezone functions

#### **UK Timezone Functions**
- `getUKTime()` - Get current UK time
- `getUKDate()` - Get UK date object
- `getUKStartOfDay()` - Start of day in UK timezone
- `getUKEndOfDay()` - End of day in UK timezone
- `isUKToday()` - Check if date is today in UK timezone
- `formatUKDate()` - Format date for UK timezone

## Database Changes

### Timezone Functions Usage
```javascript
// Get UK start/end of day
const todayStart = getUKStartOfDay();
const todayEnd = getUKEndOfDay();

// Get current UK time
const ukTime = getUKDate();

// Check if date is today in UK
const isToday = isUKToday(someDate);
```

## Error Handling

### Withdrawal Errors
- **Insufficient Balance**: User doesn't have enough funds
- **Multiple Pending**: User already has pending withdrawal
- **2FA Not Enabled**: User must enable 2FA first

### Reservation Errors
- **NFT Not Found**: Specified NFT doesn't exist
- **Already Reserved**: User already reserved today
- **NFT Already Reserved**: NFT already reserved by someone else
- **Insufficient Balance**: User needs at least $50 to buy NFT

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- **Withdrawals**: Existing withdrawal records remain unchanged

- **Users**: No user data changes required

### New Features
- **OTP System**: Uses existing EmailVerification model
- **NFT Selection**: Requires frontend updates to show available NFTs
- **UK Timezone**: All new operations use UK timezone

## Frontend Integration

### Withdrawal Flow
```javascript
// Step 1: Request withdrawal
const response1 = await fetch('/api/v1/withdraw/withdraw', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ amount: 100 })
});

// Step 2: Confirm with OTP and 2FA
const response2 = await fetch('/api/v1/withdraw/withdraw/confirm', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    amount: 100, 
    googleAuthCode: '123456', 
    otp: '789012' 
  })
});
```

### Reservation Flow
```javascript
// Get available NFTs
const availableNFTs = await fetch('/api/v1/reservation/available');

// Reserve specific NFT
const reservation = await fetch('/api/v1/reservation/reserve', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ nftId: 'nft_id_here' })
});
```

This update significantly improves the security and user experience of both the withdrawal and reservation systems while implementing UK timezone consistency across the platform.
